A POC on monorepo to manage multi packages and sharable codebase

# Lerna tutorial

## TLDR;

* `npm install` (installs lerna)
* `lerna bootstrap` (connects all the packages)
* `npm -C ./packages/usage run start` (console logs "alpha" and "beta" from combind use example module)

* Tree Structure

* `packages`
  * `alpha` (`deps: []`)
  * `beta` (`deps: []`)
  * `usage` (`deps: ["alpha", "beta"]`)

## Summary

First off, What is [`lerna`](https://github.com/lerna/lerna)? [`lerna`](https://github.com/lerna/lerna) is a tool that allows you to maintain multiple `npm` packages within one repository.

There's a couple of benefits to this kind of approach, the paradigm is called a `monorepo`, and more can be read about it from the [source of `babel`, and `react`](https://github.com/babel/babel/blob/master/doc/design/monorepo.md).

Here's the gist:

* Single lint, build, test and release process.
* Easy to coordinate changes across modules.
* Single place to report issues.
* Easier to setup a development environment.
* Tests across modules are ran together which finds bugs that touch multiple modules easier.

## Getting started.

For this demo I'm going to be using `lerna@2.0.0-beta.20`. [`lerna`](https://github.com/lerna/lerna) is a CLI (command line interface) tool. You're going to want to install it with the `--global` (`-g`) flag.

```
npm i lerna@2.0.0-beta.20 -g
```

Then once it's done installing your going to want to run the following

```
lerna init
```

This will do a couple of things.

* Creating packages folder.
* Updating package.json.
* Creating lerna.json.

The `/packages` folder is where all of your packages belong. Let's go about making a new package `alpha`.

```
cd packages
mkdir alpha
cd alpha
npm init -y
echo "module.exports = 'alpha'" > index.js
```

Lets go through the same steps for another package `beta`.

First go up one directory:

```
cd ..
```

Now go about creating `beta`.

```
mkdir beta
cd beta
npm init -y
echo "module.exports = 'beta'" > index.js
```

Now we're going to create a `usage` package that uses both `alpha` and `beta` as dependencies.

First go up one directory:

```
cd ..
```

Now go about creating `\usage`.

```
mkdir usage
cd usage
npm init -y
touch index.js
```

Open up `/packages/usage/index.js` in a text editor and paste this in.

```js
var alpha = require('alpha')
var beta = require('beta')
console.log(alpha + " " + beta)
```

We're almost there. At this point your whole project should look something like this:

```
.
├── README.md
├── lerna.json
├── package.json
└── packages
    ├── alpha
    │   ├── index.js
    │   └── package.json
    ├── beta
    │   ├── index.js
    │   └── package.json
    └── usage
        ├── index.js
        └── package.json
```

What you want to do now is go into `/packages/usage/package.json` and add these lines under `dependencies`.

```json
{
  "dependencies": {
    "alpha": "1.0.0",
    "beta": "1.0.0"  
  }
}
```

Now you need to wire everything up with this command.

```
lerna bootstrap
```

The output from this command should look something like this:

```
Lerna v2.0.0-beta.20
Linking all dependencies
Successfully bootstrapped 3 packages.
```

Now using the `tree` command once more (`brew install tree`) we can see the folder structure we can see what [`lerna`](https://github.com/lerna/lerna) did.

```
.
├── README.md
├── lerna.json
├── package.json
└── packages
    ├── alpha
    │   ├── index.js
    │   ├── node_modules
    │   └── package.json
    ├── beta
    │   ├── index.js
    │   ├── node_modules
    │   └── package.json
    └── usage
        ├── index.js
        ├── node_modules
        │   ├── alpha
        │   │   ├── index.js
        │   │   └── package.json
        │   └── beta
        │       ├── index.js
        │       └── package.json
        └── package.json
```

It added two `stubbed` (my term not [`lerna`](https://github.com/lerna/lerna)'s) modules. If you peak inside `/packages/usage/node_modules/alpha/index.js` you can see what I mean.

> contents of `./packages/usage/node_modules/alpha/index.js`

```js
module.exports = require("/Users/thomas/Desktop/lerna-tutorial/packages/alpha");
```

> Note: This is an absolute path to the module. So if you ever move your lerna project you'll need to rerun `lerna bootstrap`.

And volia! When we run `node ./packages/usage/index.js` we get our expected output!

```
alpha beta
```
